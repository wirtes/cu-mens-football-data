# cu-mens-football-data
A respository of the Men's football game scores for the University of Colorado Boulder from 1902-2024.

This was made as part of an experiment to attach natural language interfaces to existing enterprise APIs in 2017. Over time, I'm only maintaing `scores_raw.csv` file. Older versions without the latest seasons added are in the `/old` folder.

`mens_football-table-definition.sql` gives an overview of the data table and a File Format definition for loading csv data into Snowflake.

`scores.csv` is a comma-separated file of CU football scores from 1902-2022.

`Robot.Ralphie.Final.Demo.mp4` is a short video of a Google Assistant accessing enterprise data APIs in a live demo.
